# GHL API Coverage Report

Generated from official GHL docs commit: 0af86a4

## Source Snapshot

- Official docs repo: https://github.com/GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs.git
- Docs checkout: `tmp/highlevel-api-docs`
- Docs commit: `0af86a4cbd48c66a4071c7e509d1079f9f10ed17`
- Docs tag/description: `0af86a4`
- Official endpoint references parsed: 590
- Local endpoint references parsed: 851
- Local TypeScript files scanned: 64

## Coverage Summary

- Unique official endpoints: 590
- Unique local endpoints: 843
- Official endpoints with an exact method/path match locally: 590
- Exact-match coverage: 100%
- Likely missing official endpoints: 0
- Potential local-only/deprecated/private endpoints: 253

Exact matching is intentionally conservative. Dynamic path generation, aliases, and compatibility wrappers may create false positives, but this gives us a repeatable first-pass map.

## Changelog-Only Findings To Plan Around

- 2026-04-28 — Users: GET /users/ endpoint deprecated (https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Changelog/index.html)

- 2026-04-15 — Users/Scopes: New user scope enum values added for audit logs, location management, and payments settings (https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Changelog/index.html)
- Recent product changelog — Emails: Email Campaign V2 APIs introduced; future email campaign improvements focus on V2 endpoints (https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/changelog/new-improved-email-marketing-public-apis)

## High-Priority Missing Official Endpoints

- None found.

## Potential Local-Only High-Risk Endpoints

These deserve manual review because they may be legacy, private, renamed, or simply not matched by the scanner.

## Recommended Update Plan

1. Keep the scanner pointed at both the official GitHub OpenAPI fragments and live-docs supplemental endpoints that have not landed in the GitHub repo yet.
2. Make `GHL_API_VERSION` configurable in all server entry points and keep endpoint-specific overrides for APIs that still require older version headers.
3. Mark deprecated `GET /users/` behavior clearly in user-facing docs/tool descriptions while preserving compatibility as long as the official spec still lists it.
4. Keep the first-class top-level Notes module in place for the 2026-04-21 changelog endpoints, and reconcile it against the official spec once those endpoints land in the docs repo.
5. Keep Email Campaign V2 tools under `/emails/public/v2/*` as live-docs supplemental coverage until HighLevel publishes them in `apps/emails.json`.
6. Update OAuth/private-integration scope documentation for new audit-log, location-management, and payment-settings scopes.
7. Manually inspect local-only campaign, workflow, OAuth, and trigger endpoints. If they are internal/private APIs, mark them clearly in tool descriptions and README so users know their stability profile.
8. Add targeted tests for live-docs supplemental modules using the current official path, method, version header, and required query/body fields.
